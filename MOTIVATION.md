# Microsoft Graph PowerShell ❤️ Microsoft Entra PowerShell
Microsoft Entra PowerShell is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell solution. It's not competing with what you've implemented in Microsoft Graph PowerShell - you don't have to migrate again. Both modules are designed to operate with a "Better-together" approach. Microsoft Entra PowerShell investments are aimed at improving Microsoft Graph PowerShell, with thought-out cmdlet specifications, but retaining all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK in terms of authorization, connection management, error handling, (low-level) API coverage.
